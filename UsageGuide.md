## Common Errors

### Quiz Grades

If your grades are showing incorrectly (lower than what they should be), this is because PowerSchool does not show which quizzes are dropped. Don't worry, you can drop them here.

 ~~**NOTE: When your Refresh the drops go away**~~
 **Now Drops stay until you click Reset Drops or logout**
- Click on a class
- Then click on the little minus sign to drop any quizzes

This icon might be missing in some classes, and this is because I do not have the individual category weightings. If you would like that, just email me your syllabus at syllabus@aayanmaheshwari.com or whatever form of contact you would like.

## Additional Information

You can also see your GPA (which is hidden by the PowerSchool app) either at the top or by clicking the 3 lines.
