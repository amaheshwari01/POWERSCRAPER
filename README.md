# Power-Assist
this branch tries to compute grades
This is a remake to my my PowerGui/PowerScraper(I really need to get better at naming these things) but uses the mobile powerschool api instead

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and to install packages

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then make a copy of .env.example to .env an you can get ur refresh token from [Key-Finder](https://github.com/amaheshwari01/Key-Finder/)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
